# iPapkorn Advertising Policies - Get your ads approved

## Understanding our policies

Our Advertising Policies provide guidance on what types of ad content are allowed. When advertisers place an order, each ad is reviewed against these policies. If you think your ad was mistakenly disapproved, you can request a review of the decision in [Account Quality](https://t.me/hs_userge_bot).

## The ad review process
Our ad review system relies primarily on automated tools to check ads against our Advertising Policies. This happens automatically before ads begin running, and is typically completed within 23 hours, although it may take longer in some cases. During this review, the status of the ad will be "In review". Additionally, ads may be reviewed again, including after they are live. You can find more information in our Business Help Centre.

#### What is reviewed
![ad template](https://telegra.ph/file/f96bbd5b8cbf049ff5ae0.jpg)
The ad review system reviews ads for violations of our Advertising Policies. This review process may include the specific components of an ad, such as images, video, text, and targeting information, as well as an ad's associated landing page or other destinations, among other information.


#### Outcome of review

If a violation is found at any point in the review process, the ad will be rejected. Lower-quality ads that do not necessarily violate our policies may experience affected performance. You can find more information about how quality may affect your ad in our Help Centre.

#### Re-review of ads

Ads remain subject to review and re-review at all times and may be rejected for violation of our policies at any time. It is your responsibility to understand and comply with our Advertising Policies.

#### Further enforcement

Beyond enforcing our policies on individual ads, violations of our terms and policies may result in further enforcement actions, such as disabling ad accounts, Pages, Business Managers, and/or individual user accounts. Disabled accounts, Pages, or Business Managers cannot run ads, and advertisers may be ineligible to advertise. You can learn more about what to do if your ad account is disabled [here](https://t.me/hs_userge_bot) or your advertising is restricted [here](https://t.me/hs_userge_bot).


## Dos and Dont's
This is a list of tips and advice that limits what you can and cannot do on our platform.

1. Your ad should be as concise as possible, this will make it easier for users to read and understand your message. 
*PS: Using more images or words doesn't guarantee better performance, as it often ends up looking like spam.*

2. Words like "I", "my", "our", "we" and "us" should be replaced with your channel name. This would help eliminate ambiguity.

3. Kindly avoid the use of numerical or non-numerical currency values, as this can be misleading.

4. Ads categorized as crypto, forex, stocks, bets, and movies can only apply for a 3-day plan.

5. Adult content is prohibited.

6. Ads must not praise, condemn, support, or represent individuals or groups with ties to Politics or Violence.

7. Collection of user personal information is prohibited.
